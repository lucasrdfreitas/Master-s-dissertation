# Gapless excitations in Kitaev materials with defects

A quantum spin liquid is a magnetic phase of matter that is remarkable for its ground state long-range entanglement and fractional excitations. 
A  quantum spin liquid  appears in the well-known Kitaev honeycomb spin-half model. 
In a magnetic field, there is a phase transition to a topological phase with an energy gap in the bulk and chiral Majorana fermions at the edge. 
However, recent \acrlong{nmr} experiments suggest excitations without a gap in this phase, signalled by the cubic temperature dependence of the spin-lattice relaxation 
rate at low temperatures. 

In this work, I propose a mechanism to account for this experimental result. 
I use the localization of chiral Majorana modes in defects to explain the presence of gapless modes in the bulk. 
Treating the weak interaction between the chiral modes in the defects within a mean-field approximation, 
I find that these modes remain gapless when the interaction is below a critical value that depends on the magnetic field strength. 
I used the effective low-energy theory to calculate the spin-lattice relaxation rate and found a behavior that agrees with the experimental result.
